The exercise focuses on a theoretical implementation of a flight search service. 

The API should allow users to search for and filter a sorted list of airline codes (representing flights) matching their search criteria.

The service should be backed by `FlightAvailabilityService` service, which returns all data the search service requires.
 
## Important points

- The intention of the exercise is to test pragmatic core java 8-11 programming skills, OOP and domain design.
- Only the dependencies available in the pom should be used. Lombok is provided to reduce boilerplate code.
- The service should be safe to be used in a concurrent environment. Additional non-functional requirements should also be considered.
- Please mind readability and maintainability.
- Existing files must not be changed unless explicitly asked to do so. 
- Ensure that your changes can be compiled and tested running `mvn verify`. You should have JDK 11 and Maven 3.5.x+ installed.
 
## Exercise

Create a flight search service. 

The API should expect a search query as an argument and return an ordered collection of airline codes. 
The service should delegate whatever is possible to the provided `FlightAvailaibilityService` service and do additional processing of the results.
Implementation of `FlightAvailaibilityService` is expected to be provided at runtime as external dependency, so it is *not* required to provide that implementation nor testing it.

The service should use the `FlightAvailaibilityService` to get a collection of flights and then filter, sort and limit the results as per the followings:
  
- Search for flights based on origin-destination, departureDate, and number of travellers. 
- Filter results according to whether the customer wants flights which can be cancelled or not, or is happy with either.
- Filter results below an average price if customer provides such maximum price. 
- Sort the results by length of flight or average price depending on the customer's preference.
- Allow the number of results to be limited. If no limit is specified, return 3 results.
 
For more information on the provided classes in package `com.qatarairways.adapter.flight`, please refer to their javadoc documentation.

If you happen to run into any ambiguous requirements, feel free to decide on your own but please highlight your decision.

## Bonus Exercise

The current implementation of `com.qatarairways.adapter.flight.FlightAvailabilityRequest` is not ideal. Please add a FIXME comment at the problematic part.
